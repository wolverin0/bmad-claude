Could we create a way to auto-use https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD this method to code with claude code, creating something like a bmad method mcp server that grabs our prompt with a pre hook from claude code, get the intent of the prompt and auto activate the best persona with the exact command that we should use, and then use that modified prompt? Or something like that. There are so many personas and command thats its difgucult to keep up manually

Looking at the BMAD-METHOD repository, I can see it's a comprehensive AI prompting framework with various personas and commands. Creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to automatically select and apply the best BMAD persona based on your Claude Code prompts is definitely feasible and would be incredibly useful!

Here's how we could architect this solution:


BMAD Method MCP Server
Code 
Now let me create the configuration and setup files:


Package.json for BMAD MCP Server
Code 

BMAD MCP Server Setup Guide
Document 
This MCP server would work as follows:

Key Features:
Smart Intent Detection: Analyzes your prompt using keyword matching to determine the best persona
Automatic Enhancement: Prepends the appropriate BMAD persona and command to your prompt
Confidence Scoring: Only applies personas when confident about the match
Multiple Tools: Offers different ways to interact (enhance, suggest, list)
How It Integrates with Claude Code:
Pre-hook Integration: The MCP server can intercept your prompts before they reach Claude
Automatic Persona Selection: Based on keywords like "code", "review", "architecture", etc.
Command Application: Automatically adds the appropriate /dev, /review, /architect commands
Enhanced Context: Provides the full persona context from the BMAD method
Next Steps to Implement:
Install the MCP SDK: npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
Build the Server: Run npm run build
Configure Claude Code: Add the server to your MCP configuration
Extend Personas: Parse the actual BMAD repository to load all personas dynamically
Add Pre-hooks: Create shell functions or Claude Code extensions for automatic enhancement
The beauty of this approach is that you can just type your natural prompt like "Create a REST API" and the system will automatically detect it's a development task, apply the Senior Developer persona with /dev command, and enhance your prompt with the full BMAD context.

Would you like me to help you set this up, or would you prefer to see a more advanced version that directly parses the BMAD repository structure?




Dont modify anything. Lets first talk, hat if maybe the prompt needs to use maybe more than one persona, like first analysis of something and then debug or develop some feature? Will this do that job or we have to tune it?

Great question! You've identified a key limitation of the current approach. The system I designed is focused on single persona selection - it picks the "best" match and applies only one persona. But you're absolutely right that many real-world tasks are multi-stage workflows that would benefit from combining multiple personas.

Current Limitations:
The current system would fail for prompts like:

"Analyze this codebase and then refactor the authentication module" (needs Data Analyst → Senior Dev)
"Review this API design and implement the missing endpoints" (needs Code Reviewer → Senior Dev → Architect)
"Debug this performance issue and write documentation for the fix" (needs Problem Solver → Senior Dev → Tech Writer)
It would just pick ONE persona (probably the first keyword match) and miss the multi-stage nature.

Two Approaches to Fix This:
1. Sequential Workflow Detection
Detect workflow patterns like:

typescript
const WORKFLOW_PATTERNS = [
  {
    pattern: ['analyze', 'then', 'implement'],
    sequence: ['data-analyst', 'senior-dev']
  },
  {
    pattern: ['review', 'and', 'fix'],
    sequence: ['code-reviewer', 'senior-dev']
  },
  {
    pattern: ['debug', 'and', 'document'],
    sequence: ['problem-solver', 'tech-writer']
  }
];
2. Multi-Persona Prompt Engineering
Instead of picking one persona, create a hybrid prompt that combines relevant personas:

You are acting as both a Senior Developer AND a Code Reviewer. 
First, review this code for issues, then provide a refactored solution.

/dev /review

[original prompt]
Questions Before I Modify:
Do you prefer sequential execution (run analyst first, then use output for dev work) or combined personas (single prompt with multiple viewpoints)?
Should the system detect workflow keywords like "then", "and", "after", "next" to identify multi-stage tasks?
How many personas should be the max for a single prompt? (2-3 seems reasonable, more might be overwhelming)
Should there be explicit workflow commands like /workflow analyze-implement or keep it automatic detection?
The BMAD method itself seems designed around single personas, so we'd be extending beyond the original framework. But for Claude Code automation, multi-persona workflows make total sense.

What's your preference for handling these multi-stage scenarios?




Could we add another layer and instead of identifying single or múltiple words that could be mislead, analyze the prompt with LLM or something and with that the real intent of the prompt? Maybe we dont even know or notice thst we should be using x personas or maybe múltiple personas, and let claude code or claude api analyze first the prompt analyze which to use and Pass the final prompt with the commands to claude code?

Brilliant idea! You're absolutely right - keyword matching is primitive and can be misleading. Using an LLM to analyze intent and recommend personas is much more sophisticated and would catch nuances that simple keyword matching would miss.

The Meta-Analysis Approach:
Instead of pattern matching, we'd have:

Intent Analyzer LLM: Analyzes the user's prompt to understand true intent
Persona Recommender: Suggests single or multiple personas based on that analysis
Workflow Designer: If multiple personas, determines the optimal sequence/combination
Prompt Enhancer: Builds the final enhanced prompt with all necessary personas
This Would Catch Scenarios Like:
User: "This function is slow"
Keywords: ["slow"] → might pick "performance optimizer"
LLM Analysis: "User has a performance issue that needs investigation, root cause analysis, then optimization implementation"
Recommendation: Problem Solver → Senior Dev → Code Reviewer (for validation)
User: "Help me with this React component"
Keywords: ["React", "component"] → picks "Senior Dev"  
LLM Analysis: "Vague request - could be debugging, creation, optimization, or learning. Need clarification or assume most common case"
Recommendation: Ask for clarification OR assume Senior Dev with guidance persona
Architecture Would Be:
User Prompt → Intent Analyzer LLM → Persona Strategy → Enhanced Prompt → Claude Code
The Intent Analyzer could be:

Claude API call (fast, good reasoning)
Local small model (privacy, offline)
Structured prompt to Claude asking "what personas would be best for this task?"
Key Advantages:
Context Understanding: Understands implied needs the user didn't explicitly state
Workflow Intelligence: Recognizes multi-step processes automatically
Ambiguity Handling: Can ask for clarification or make intelligent assumptions
Learning: Could improve over time based on success patterns
Implementation Question:
Should the Intent Analyzer be:

Same Claude instance (meta-prompt to analyze the user's prompt first)
Separate API call (dedicated analysis call, then main prompt)
Different model (smaller, faster model just for intent analysis)
The meta-prompt approach would be elegant - Claude analyzes its own incoming prompt to determine the best BMAD strategy before proceeding. What do you think about that approach?




Ive also seen that people use gemini cli as a prehook with the command gemini -p like claude code has a -p which only return the answer, maybe we could give gemini the prompt with all the bmad doc or mcp server and get the final prompt as an answer? Its Just an idea, tell me what you think. It might not be optomal or possible

That's actually a really clever idea! Using Gemini CLI as a pre-hook analyzer is creative and could work well. Let me break down the pros and cons:

Why This Could Work Well:
Cost Efficient: Gemini is generally cheaper than Claude for this kind of analysis task
Fast Response: The -p flag gives just the answer, perfect for automation
Good at Analysis: Gemini is quite capable at understanding intent and making recommendations
Simple Pipeline: Clean separation of concerns - Gemini analyzes, Claude executes
The Flow Would Be:
bash
User prompt → Gemini CLI (analyze + recommend) → Enhanced prompt → Claude Code
Implementation Approach:
bash
# Pre-hook function
analyze_and_enhance() {
    local user_prompt="$*"
    
    # Gemini analyzes the prompt and recommends BMAD strategy
    local analysis_prompt="
    Given this user prompt: '$user_prompt'
    
    And these available BMAD personas: [BMAD documentation]
    
    Analyze the intent and return ONLY the enhanced prompt with appropriate persona(s) and commands. 
    Format: [persona commands] + enhanced context + original prompt
    "
    
    local enhanced_prompt=$(gemini -p "$analysis_prompt")
    
    # Send enhanced prompt to Claude Code
    claude-code "$enhanced_prompt"
}
Potential Challenges:
Context Limits: Gemini would need the full BMAD documentation in each call (might hit token limits)
Consistency: Different LLMs might interpret BMAD methods differently
Latency: Two API calls instead of one
Prompt Engineering: Need to tune the analysis prompt to get consistent output format
Optimization Ideas:
Cached BMAD Summary: Instead of full docs, give Gemini a condensed version of personas
Structured Output: Use Gemini's JSON mode to get structured recommendations
Local Cache: Cache common prompt patterns to avoid repeated analysis
Alternative: Hybrid Approach
What if we combine both approaches?

MCP Server for common patterns (fast, local)
Gemini Analysis for complex/ambiguous prompts (when MCP confidence is low)
bash
bmad_enhance() {
    # Try MCP first
    local mcp_result=$(claude-code --tool suggest_persona "$*")
    local confidence=$(echo "$mcp_result" | grep "Confidence:" | cut -d: -f2)
    
    if [[ "$confidence" > "0.7" ]]; then
        # High confidence, use MCP
        claude-code --tool enhance_prompt "$*"
    else
        # Low confidence, use Gemini analysis
        analyze_with_gemini "$*"
    fi
}
Questions:
Have you tested Gemini CLI's consistency with structured prompts like this?
What's your experience with Gemini's reasoning compared to Claude for this kind of meta-analysis?
Would the extra latency (Gemini → Claude) be acceptable for the better intent analysis?
The idea has merit! Gemini could be excellent at the "meta-thinking" while Claude handles the actual execution. What's your experience with Gemini CLI reliability for this kind of structured output?




I dont mind about the latency, Google pro 2.5 is extremely capable of this Task. What if we install the bmad method mcp in the gemini cli, will the -P command be able to call the mcp tool?

Great question! Unfortunately, from what I know about Gemini CLI, it doesn't have native MCP (Model Context Protocol) support like Claude Code does.

Current State:
Claude Code: Has built-in MCP support, can call MCP tools with --tool flag
Gemini CLI: Typically just does text completion, doesn't have MCP integration (as far as I know)
But There Are Workarounds:
Option 1: Direct Integration
Instead of MCP, we could build the BMAD logic directly into a wrapper script:

bash
#!/bin/bash
# bmad-gemini-analyzer.sh

user_prompt="$*"

# Create analysis prompt with embedded BMAD knowledge
analysis_prompt="
You are an expert at analyzing user intents and selecting the best AI personas for tasks.

Available BMAD Personas:
- Senior Developer (/dev): coding, programming, development, debugging
- Code Reviewer (/review): code audits, security, quality assessment  
- Software Architect (/architect): system design, architecture, patterns
- Data Analyst (/analyze): data analysis, statistics, insights
- Business Analyst (/business): requirements, processes, workflows
- Creative Writer (/write): content creation, storytelling, blogs
- Technical Writer (/doc): documentation, guides, tutorials
- Problem Solver (/solve): troubleshooting, general problem solving

User prompt: '$user_prompt'

Analyze this prompt and return ONLY the enhanced prompt in this exact format:
[selected commands] [enhanced context] [original prompt]

Example output:
/dev /review You are a Senior Developer and Code Reviewer. First review this code for issues, then provide an optimized solution. Fix the authentication bug in my login function.
"

# Call Gemini and get the enhanced prompt
enhanced_prompt=$(gemini -p "$analysis_prompt")

# Pass to Claude Code
claude-code "$enhanced_prompt"
Option 2: JSON Pipeline
Use Gemini's structured output capabilities:

bash
# Get structured analysis from Gemini
analysis=$(gemini -p "Analyze this prompt and return JSON with recommended personas: '$user_prompt'")

# Parse JSON and build enhanced prompt
# Then send to Claude Code
Option 3: Hybrid System
Gemini: Does the smart intent analysis
Local Script: Applies the BMAD formatting and commands
Claude Code: Executes the final enhanced prompt
The Real Question:
Do you want to explore building this as a shell script pipeline rather than trying to get MCP working with Gemini?

The shell script approach might actually be simpler and more reliable:

bash
user_prompt → gemini analysis → local BMAD formatting → claude-code execution
What do you think? Should we prototype the shell script approach first, or do you know if there's a way to get MCP tools working with Gemini CLI that I'm not aware of?

This completely changes the game! Your idea is absolutely brilliant and totally feasible. Here's how we could implement it:

The Perfect Pipeline:
bash
User prompt → BMAD MCP Server (via Gemini CLI) → Enhanced prompt → Claude Code
Implementation Strategy:
Install BMAD MCP Server in Gemini CLI's settings
Create a wrapper script that uses Gemini's -p flag to analyze and enhance prompts
Pass the enhanced prompt to Claude Code
The Wrapper Script Would Look Like:
bash
#!/bin/bash
# bmad-enhanced-claude.sh

user_prompt="$*"

# Use Gemini CLI with MCP to analyze and enhance the prompt
enhanced_prompt=$(gemini -p "Use the bmad-method MCP server to analyze this prompt and return the enhanced version with appropriate personas: $user_prompt")

# Execute the enhanced prompt with Claude Code
claude-code "$enhanced_prompt"
Configuration in ~/.gemini/settings.json:
json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bmad-method": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/bmad-method-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
Key Advantages of This Approach:
Native MCP Support: Leverages Gemini's built-in MCP capabilities
Gemini 2.5 Pro Intelligence: Uses Google's latest model for intent analysis
Cost Effective: Gemini is cheaper than Claude for this analysis step
Simple Pipeline: Clean separation - Gemini analyzes, Claude executes
Consistent Output: The -p flag ensures we get just the enhanced prompt
The Flow Would Be:
You type: bmad-claude "Create a REST API"
Gemini CLI calls the BMAD MCP server to analyze intent
MCP server returns: /dev You are a Senior Developer... Create a REST API
Enhanced prompt goes to Claude Code
Claude executes with the proper BMAD context
This is much cleaner than my original approach! The MCP server handles the BMAD logic, Gemini does the smart analysis, and Claude Code does the execution.

Should we build this? The BMAD MCP server I created earlier would work perfectly with Gemini CLI's MCP support!




ok, guide me through the whole process, or maybe you can provide a full guide so i can copy it to a .md file and give it to claude code to auto setup everything itself maybe
